Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classActorFramework_1_1Actor}{Actor\+Framework\+::\+Actor}} \\*This is the main class of the program. Actors will be in charge of executing the simulation. Communication between actors is done using messages }{\pageref{classActorFramework_1_1Actor}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classActorFramework_1_1ExecutionUnit}{Actor\+Framework\+::\+Execution\+Unit}} \\*Execution units are in charge of processing all the actors. When an actor is created it should be assigned to an execution unit which will execute it. Execution units are in charge of controlling communication between actors calling the internal functions. They are also in charge of distributing load to try to keep a more balanced execution }{\pageref{classActorFramework_1_1ExecutionUnit}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classActorFramework_1_1Logger}{Actor\+Framework\+::\+Logger}} \\*This class handles different logging levels, allowing to have different messages for debug and execution }{\pageref{classActorFramework_1_1Logger}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classActorFramework_1_1Message}{Actor\+Framework\+::\+Message}} \\*Messages are shared between different execution units for internal and intra-\/actor communication }{\pageref{classActorFramework_1_1Message}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structActorFramework_1_1Message_1_1MessageData}{Actor\+Framework\+::\+Message\+::\+Message\+Data}} \\*\mbox{\hyperlink{classActorFramework_1_1Message}{Message}} send between actor }{\pageref{structActorFramework_1_1Message_1_1MessageData}}{}
